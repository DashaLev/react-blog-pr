        text:"People often ask if my travels have been fulfilling, or if I regretted taking off.  That’s not to say every day has been perfect, but on the whole I have been lucky enough to explore some extraordinary countries, meet terrific new friends and eat as much food as possible",
        about:"My travels evolved from living out of a backpack for several years, to now having a home base in Mexico and moving around for 4-6 months of the year. If you told me back in 1998, when I went to law school, that I would be running a food and travel business from around the world in 2017? I would have laughed at the impossibility. I thought I would be a lawyer in New York and eventually shift into a public advocacy legal role. Never did I think I would be a writer and public speaker. I grew up in Montreal, Quebec, and spend my childhood skiing and playing soccer and not really thinking about long-term travel or food. It wasn’t until I saw a documentary about Siberia in high school that I began to think about heading there myself, a seed that grew bit by bit as the years went by. Prior to founding Legal Nomads, I worked for 5 years in New York as a corporate lawyer, having studied in Canada and then accepted an offer at a firm in Manhattan. My school debt was minimal due to Canadian tuition rates, and as I practiced law I was also able to save up for my dream trip. I am honored that my writing has resonated with a growing community of readers. I’ve tried to share the good and the bad, the ups and the downs, and the stories that I learn along the way.",

        text:"Every year we become more and more obsessed with our phones, with how we look, about the evidence of our lives, and I think it’s getting to the point where we are forgetting to actually live. This is something I strive to work on all the time and fail spectacularly at. If things go on, what will the world be like in a decade?",
        about:"Hello! You’ve found me, and I’m so glad you’re here; it’s meant to be! I’m that cliche “ordinary girl on an extraordinary journey” if one is allowed to say her own life is extraordinary at 31. Basically, I travel a lot. Usually alone too, that way I don’t have to compromise. A friend once described me as cynical but kind in equal measure, a disturbingly accurate bio. If you’re a fan of chaos, brutal honesty, sarcasm and girls who think they are wittier than they actually are, then you’ve come to the place. No, no don’t run away just yet. I started this blog around ten years ago in 2010 when I was getting ready to move to Spain to teach English and procrastinate on life. I’m sure you can relate. I thought my path would take me to graduate school to become a medieval history professor (raises eyebrows). Instead I turned out to be a professional nomad (read: hobo). My parents are, of course, thrilled. In the meantime, if you want to catch up with me in real-time, follow me below and be sure to subscribe to my emails!",
